    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>Whether a berry is good or bad is affected by its appearance and you will need to try to learn the rule that tells you which are the good berries. For example, the rule might be "shiny berries are good", or it could be more complicated, for example, "blue berries with pale spots and red berries with bold spots are good".<p/>
    <p>On every round you will first be shown some berries and told whether they are good or bad. You should use this information to try to work out what makes berries good or bad.<p/>
    <p>After this training period you will then be shown some berries and asked to categorize them.</p>
